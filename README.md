## Introduction

The goal of this project is to build predictive models to estimate agricultural yield based on various features such as area under crop, value of pesticides/herbicides used, fertilizer used, average rainfall, and average temperature.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Agricultural Survey Dataset, which contains the following columns:

- `year`: Year of the survey
- `district`: District where the survey was conducted
- `farm_id`: Unique identifier for each farm
- `area_under_crop`: Area under crop in hectares
- `sector`: Sector of the farm
- `crop_type`: Type of crop grown
- `value_pesticides/herbicides`: Value of pesticides/herbicides used
- `fertilizer_used_kg/hectare`: Fertilizer used in kg per hectare
- `average_rainfall`: Average rainfall in mm
- `average_temperature`: Average temperature in degrees Celsius
- `yield`: Yield in tonnes

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA was performed to understand the distribution and relationships of the features in the dataset. Key steps included:

- Displaying the first few rows of the dataset
- Checking for missing values
- Descriptive statistics of selected columns
- Visualizing the number of records per district and sector
- Calculating and plotting the average yield per hectare by crop type and year
- Visualizing the distribution of numerical features and count plots of categorical features
- Boxplots for numerical features

## Preprocessing

Preprocessing steps included:

- Dropping the `farm_id` column
- Handling missing values by filling them with the median for numerical columns
- Detecting and handling outliers using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method
- Normalizing numerical features using MinMaxScaler
- Encoding categorical features using one-hot encoding

## Model Training and Tuning

Four machine learning models were trained and tuned:

1. **Linear Regression**
2. **Random Forest Regressor**
3. **XGBoost Regressor**
4. **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)**

Each model was trained on the preprocessed dataset, and predictions were made on the test set.

## Model Evaluation

The models were evaluated using the following metrics:

- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- RÂ² Score

The evaluation results were compared across models to determine the best-performing model.

## Feature Importance

Feature importance was calculated for each model to understand the contribution of each feature to the predictions. The importance scores were aggregated and visualized.

## Hyperparameter Tuning

Hyperparameter tuning was performed for the XGBoost and Random Forest models using GridSearchCV. The best parameters were identified, and the models were retrained with these optimal parameters.

## Visualization

Various visualizations were created to understand the data and model performance, including:

- Bar plots for the number of records per district and sector
- Bar plots for average yield per hectare by crop type and year
- Distribution plots for numerical features
- Count plots for categorical features
- Boxplots for numerical features
- Comparison plots for model predictions vs. true values
- Bar plots for aggregated feature importance
